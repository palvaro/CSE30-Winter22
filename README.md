# Description

## Official Description

<i> Introduction to software development in Python focusing on structuring software in terms of objects endowed with primitive operations. Introduces concepts and techniques via a sequence of concrete case studies. Coursework consists of programming assignments and a final examination.</i>

## Informal Description

The goal of this course is to introduce you to basic techniques for solving lots of programming problems common in computer science. The approach we will take is to consider what objects are useful for representing a problem, what operations can be defined on those objects, and what mathematical properties those operations should have. 

All the programming work we do in this course will be done in Python, using [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) notebooks. A notebook is an interactive document that can contain live code (in Python and other languages, although we’ll only be using Python), narrative text, visualizations, and equations. Jupyter notebooks are incredibly widely used in industry and research.

In particular, we’ll be using the [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb) (“Colab” for short) hosted notebook environment. This approach has several advantages: there’s nothing to install or maintain on your computer, you can work from any machine with an internet connection, your work is automatically saved and backed up in Google Drive, and if you want to share your in-progress homework with the course staff, all you have to do is share a URL with them, and they’ll see exactly what you see.

If you don’t want to use a proprietary Google product, you can also install Jupyter Notebook locally and do the homework that way, but you do so at your own risk and inconvenience. We're sympathetic to not wanting to use Google products, but the course staff cannot help you debug issues with your local Python environment (a non-issue if you use Colab), and you won’t get the peace of mind that comes with automatic backups.

 
# Prerequisites

The official prerequisite is CSE20 (formerly CMPS5P), aka "Introduction to Programming (in Python)" aka "Python for Poets."  What is really required for the course is some programming experience and some proficiency in Python.  I am happy to share permission codes with students who have both of these prerequisite skills, despite what courses you may have taken. 
 
# Assigments and Grading

## Grading

| Subject | Share |
|-------|---------|
| Participation | 5% |
| Attendance | 5% |
| Projects   | 90%   | 

We will not have midterm exams or a final exam in this course.

Lecture attendance will count towards 5% of your grade. Attendance will be taken in class via short, ungraded quizzes. We will excuse up to three absences without need for justification, and more as appropriate with valid justification.

Participation is another 5% of the course grade. (Just showing up to lecture doesn’t count as participation in and of itself.) We evaluate participation in a holistic way, including participation in lectures and sections (i.e., speaking up often enough to make an impression on course staff), in office hours, in tutoring hours, on Discord (answering your classmates’ questions well, and/or asking good questions), and beyond. You do not have to participate in all these ways to get full participation credit, but if you participate in none or almost none of them, don’t expect to get much participation credit.

## Late homework policy

We will not accept late homework. The homework is graded automatically in large part, and we cannot accept late homework; we don’t have a way to grade it. (Thus you should turn in however much you have done by the deadline, even if it’s only partially complete.)


# Academic honesty

Collaboration is a key part of research.  We encourage you to discuss the readings and the final project ideas with your classmates.  However, you must reveal the students with whom you discussed the assignments.  Failure to do so will result in formal disciplinary proceedings.  

We should not need to say so, but we do: plagiarism in any form is not acceptable and will not be tolerated.  As researchers, we always stand upon the shoulders of giants, and building upon existing work is the norm.  It is essential, however, that we provide proper attribution.  When in doubt, cite!  

## Formal Collaboration Policy

All the homework you turn in for this course must be your own, independent work. You can ask the TAs and tutors for advice, but you cannot copy from others: once you understand the concepts, you must write your own code. While you work on your own solution, you can:

 * Discuss with others the general techniques involved (without sharing your code with them).
 * Use the Python documentation, and any other public website. If you use code you find elsewhere, properly attribute it (using a comment with the full URL). For example, if you use code from (say, for example) https://stackoverflow.com/questions/952914/how-to-make-a-flat-list-out-of-list-of-lists, you should cite that entire URL in a comment. Don’t just leave a comment saying “I got this from Stack Overflow”.

You cannot:

 * Copy from password-protected sites, such as homework exchange sites.
 * Share the homework notebooks that are provided to you with anyone other than the course staff.

# Getting Help

Students come to CSE30 with different backgrounds, skills and abilities.  We try to teach the course in a way that benefits everyone and adjust to the needs of the class whenever we can.  It is your responsibility as a student to ask for help if you fall behind or are having difficulty with the material.  We have a lot of great resources for obtaining help:

 * We will hold two hours of office hours per week.  When you arrive at office hours, please feel free to walk in even if there are already students inside -- this way, we can answer questions as a group and make better use of the time.  If you need to speak with me privately, please let me know and we will find a time either within or outside of regular office hours.  Office hours are a great place to discuss concepts.

 * The TAs will host at least four 1-hour sections per week, where they will be assisted by our amazing team of group tutors.  Sections are a great place to ask specific questions about the homeworks.

 * We will use Discord as a discussion forum.  Discord tends to be as good as the students make it: please use it both to ask and to answer (for participation credit!) questions about lecture as well as general questions about topics covered in homeworks.

 * Please email the cse30_staff-group@ucsc.edu mailing list, rather than personal emails, to communicate private issues with the instructor or the TAs. This will make it easier for us to keep all of the class communication in one place and not overlook any of your messages. If you send messages to the personal accounts of the instructors or TAs we cannot guarantee a response.

# Acknowledgements

This course is based on [Luca de Alfaro’s](https://sites.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/luca/) CSE 30 course design, and the course materials are based on those that he created for [his fall 2019 version of the course](https://sites.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/luca/classes/cse-30/cse-30-fall-2019). (That said, we take full responsibility for this course, so if you don’t like the design of this course, you should complain to Peter & Alex, not Luca.)

This syllabus is largely derived from that of our colleague [Lindsey Kuper](http://composition.al/about/), who also taught the course previously.
